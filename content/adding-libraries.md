Sometimes a drupal module needs a external library in order to function correctly. There libraries are normally
javascript libraries that are no available in [packagist](https://packagist.org/). In order to added it to the project
you must update the composer.json and then require the library.

## Updating composer.json

Normally all of these libraries have a CSV repository page (normally Github) and have a release section with all the
tags. Copy the url and tag and replace it in the json below. Also don't forget to replace the `PROJECT-NAME` and the
`LIBRARY-NAME` with the correct values.

```json
{
  "type": "package",
  "package": {
    "name": "PROJECT-NAME/LIBRARY-NAME",
    "version": "VERSION-STRING--PLEASE-REPLACE-ME!!!!!!!!!!",
    "type": "drupal-library",
    "dist": {
      "type": "zip",
      "url": "FULL-URL-TO-THE-ZIP-FILE--PLEASE-REPLACE-ME!!!!!!!!!!"
    },
    "autoload": {
      "classmap": ["."]
    }
  }
}
```

Copy the json above, with the correct values, and add it to the `composer.json` located in the root of the project. Find
the `repositories` key and paste it there.

## Adding the library to the project

Finally in other to add the library you just have to run `composer require PROJECT-NAME/LIBRARY-NAME`. If you did
everything correctly and composer doesn't throw any errors you should be able to see the library in `build/html/libraries`
